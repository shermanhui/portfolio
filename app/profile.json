I started by creating a simple list, and added a simple search functionality with hardcoded data.

			"method": "Having no previous knowledge of MVVM concepts, I took a lot of time learning how to create the todoMVC project. After completing the todo list. I created a small sandbox project solely to learn about the GoogleMaps API. Once I understood how to use the API, I combined the todo-list logic with the map logic to create a small map that displayed a list of locations. Afterwards, I had to learn how to implement AJAX calls to retrieve data from third party APIs, as well as allow the user to communicate with the API via my application. Again, I took this task and built a smaller project to get the functionalities to work before implementing it into my project. Finally, I was able to get a dynamic list of locations to populate depending on the location the user input.",

The code was originally in Python, porting it over to JavaScript was a great learning experience because I got more exposureto how JavaScript's Object Orientated nature, closures, inheritence and scope work in a game. One of the key things I learned is that even functions are objects in JS, and that blew my mind.",

A lot of review over closures, scopes, the keyword 'this' and prototypal inheritence was required before I even touched the keyboard. Once I understood the basic concepts. I built a game object class and extended that into Player, Enemy and Gem classes. I implemented simple collision, screen wrap around, and scoring logic to complete the basic functionalities. From there I used Udacity's game engine to produce the simple Frogger clone in the link above!",
